## Differences from Cactbot

- The default configuration entry for all modules is `src/<module name>/index.js`

### Raidboss module

- Trigger files in `raidboss` must be placed in the `data` directory
- Trigger files must be exported as `export default { ... }`
- `import` statement or `require` function is required when loading custom timelines with `timelineFile` and `overrideTimelineFile`. [Example](./src/raidboss/data/test.ts)
